# dokdo

Dokdo is a Python package for microbiome sequencing analysis, which can be used as a command line tool and as a Python module. Dokdo is designed to be used with [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/), a powerful community-developed platform for microbiome bioinformatics. There is no installation for Dokdo; only QIIME 2 is required. For details, please see the Wiki page.

The Wiki page is the official user documentation for Dokdo, including instructions, tutorials, and other important information. The page also documents select information and resources pertaining to QIIME 2 that I find particularly useful.

Pull requests are always welcome.
