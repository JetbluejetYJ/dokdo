# dokdo

Dokdo is a lightweight Python package for microbiome sequencing analysis, which can be used as a command line tool and as a Python module. Dokdo is designed to be used with [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/), a powerful community-developed platform for microbiome bioinformatics. For example, you can use the Dokdo command line interface to create or manipulate various input files for QIIME 2 (e.g. a manifest file) and also perform secondary analyses. Furthermore, the Dokdo application programming interface allows the user to, for instance, easily and flexibly create publication-quality figures with the output files from QIIME 2.

There is no installation for Dokdo. Simply clone this repository and you are good to go. However, QIIME 2 is required.

For more details, please see the Wiki page which serves as the official user documentation for Dokdo, including instructions, tutorials, and other important information. The page also documents select information and resources pertaining to QIIME 2 that I find particularly useful.

Pull requests are always welcome.
