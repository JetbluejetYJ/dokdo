# dokdo

Dokdo is a Python package for microbiome sequencing analysis, which can be used as a standalone program and as a Python module. Dokdo is designed to be used with [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/). For details, please see the Wiki page.

The Wiki page is the official user documentation for Dokdo, including instructions, tutorials, and other important information. The page also documents select information and resources pertaining to QIIME 2 that I find particularly useful.

Pull requests are welcome.
